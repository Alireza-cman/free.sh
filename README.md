 Get rid of AUT Login on servers
## Introduction
With the beginning of the AUT policies for internet usage, servers has encountered lots of problem for getting 
rid of this new policy. I tried to use this bash script for getting rid of this system.


## Running
Running is pretty simple:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tabrizian/free.sh  && cd free.sh
./free
```

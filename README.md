 Get rid of AUT Login on servers
## Introduction
With the beginning of the AUT policies for internet usage, servers has encountered lots of problem for getting 
rid of this new policy. I tried to use this bash script for getting rid of this system.


## Running
Running is pretty simple:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tabrizian/free.sh  && cd free.sh
# For logging in with default arguments
./free
# For logging in with your username and password
./free yourautusername password
# For logging out
./logout
```
**NOTE:** Use it **without** your postfix i.e. *@aut.ac.ir*.  
By default it logins with the test username and password.*(**
